## feng - feature engineering for machine-learning champions

feng is a Python module for smoothly engineering features from your Pandas DataFrame so that you can win that Kaggle competition.

### Why Feng?
> *We spent most of our efforts in feature engineering.*

feng helps data scientists in what is arguably the most critical part of a machine-learning pipeline: [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering). 

It's built for fans of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and makes use of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) pipelines and transformers.

> *... some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the difference? Easily the most important factor is the features used.*
